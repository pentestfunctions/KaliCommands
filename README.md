# KaliCommands
Repository for making WSL and Windows one. 

### Installation
Well you should already have WSL installed so

```bash
wsl git clone https://github.com/pentestfunctions/KaliCommands.git /mnt/c/KaliCommands
```
- Run that directly in a standard windows terminal. 

Now in your windows file explorer just navigate to `C:\KaliCommands` and access the programs/tools in there.
